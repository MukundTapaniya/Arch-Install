### Prerequisites

- Bootable arch linux pendrive
- Stable internet connection (explained on step number 1)

---
## Installation

### Step 1 : Connect to the internet

 Connect wia the ethernet (preferrable)
#### or

 Connect wia wifi using iwctl tool

- Enter the iwctl interactive shell:
    ```bash
    iwctl
    ```
- Inside iwctl shell,check for available wireless interfaces
    ```bash 
    device list
    ```
    list of available devices will be visible.

- To connect to available network select preferred station with: 

    ```bash
    device wlan0 show
    ```
    ```bash
    station wlan0 get-networks
    ```
- Connect to your wifi network with:
    ```bash
    station wlan0 connect your_wifi_network
    ```
    Enter the passphrase.

- Check the internet connection with
    ```bash
    ping archlinux.org
    ```

### Step 2 : Partitioning disk for installation

To check for available drives: 
```bash
lsblk
```

Remove the previous partition with and intialization of new partition can be done by cfdisk:

```bash
cfdisk /dev/sda
```

Create three partitions of EFI boot manager, root partition and swap partition

### Step 3 : Mount the partitions

```
root@archiso ~ # lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
archiso/airootfs
sda      8:0    0   931.5G  0 disk
â”œâ”€sda1   8:1    0   512M 0 part
â”œâ”€sda2   8:2    0    16G  0 part
â””â”€sda3   8:3    0 914.9G  0 part
root@archiso ~ #
```
Here,
- sda1 is EFI boot manager.
- sda2 is swap partition (virtual memory).
- sda3 is root partition.

*Paritions are still not intialized and not mounted, it can be done manually*

Firstly, format root partition by

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
```

Then, format boot manager partition by,

```bash
mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
```

Lastly, create swap partition by

```bash
mkswap /dev/sda2
```
*Its time to mount each partition*

mount root partition with,

```bash
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
```
 
Boot partition can be mounted by creating mount point directory with following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
```
```bash
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi
```

We don't need to mount swap partition, just turn it on with:

```bash 
swapon /dev/sda2
```

And, the final result should look like this

```
root@archiso ~ # lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
archiso/airootfs
sda      8:0    0   931.5G  0 disk
â”œâ”€sda1   8:1    0     512M  0 part /mnt/boot/efi
â”œâ”€sda2   8:2    0      16G  0 part [SWAP]
â””â”€sda3   8:3    0   914.9G  0 part /mnt
root@archiso ~ #
```

### Step 4 : Installing the base system

Use pacstrap script to install the base package, Linux Kernal and firmware:

```bash
pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware sof-firmware base-devel grub efibootmgr nano networkmanager
```

After entering this command, base arch system packages with its core will get installed in the root partition. It may take some time according to internet connection.

************************

Information of the file system can be found with genfstab with:

```bash
genfstab /mnt
```
You may see output look something like this:
```
root@archiso ~ # genfstab /mnt
# UUID=4a806a2c-2fcf-4d3f-943e-10dc76aa4b43 /  ext4 rw,relatime                                0 1
# UUID=20DA-C959                             /boot/efi  ufat rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022, 0 2
/dev/sda1                                                 shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro
# UUID=2d38df14-9f29-4a3e-b2ee-7f09ac6685a7  none       swap defaults                                0 0
/dev/sda2
```
This information is on terminal, but we have to store it on out disk, it can be done via:

```bash
genfstab /mnt > /mnt/etc/fstab
```

*(optional) To ensure whether it is store or not:*

```bash
cat /mnt/etc/fstab
```

The base system is installed and stored on out disk.

### Step 5 : Configuring the arch linux system
We can now enter to our system with chroot
```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

- Configuration of the Time Zone
    ```bash
    ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
    ```
    check the date and time with "date" command.

    Synchronize the hardware clock with
    ```bash
    hwclock --systohc
    ```
- Configuration of the Localization
    ```bash
    nano /etc/locale.gen
    ```
    I am going to use "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8", use it by uncommenting the line. And save the file with CTRL+O to save and CTRL+X to exit.
    
    Check the locale with:
    ```bash
    locale-gen
    ```
    You should see output like this:
    ```
    Generating locales...
    en_US.UTF-8... done
    Generation complete.
    ```
    Again, specify the locale in /etc/locale.conf with following commands:
    ```bash
    nano /etc/locale.conf
    ```
    and paste following line on it:
    ```bash
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ```
    once again, you can save it with CTRL+O and CTRL+X to exit.

- Configuration of Hostname
*Hostname : A hostname is a name used to identify a device on a network.*

```bash
nano /etc/hostname
```
Enter desired hostname and exit.
set the password by,
```bash
passwd
```
### Step 6 : Adding a user in Arch Linux
* Adding the user
    ```bash
    useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash user_name
    ```
    Here, 

    *-m means create a home directory.*

    *-G means group is wheel*
    
    *user_name, put your desired username*

#### or

* *(optional) if you don't want to put user in wheel group then,*

    ```bash
    useradd -m user_name
    ```

- Enter the user password with:
    ```bash
    passwd user_name
    ```
- For running sudo commands in user do following changes
    ```bash
    EDITOR=nano visudo
    ```
    inside the /etc/sudoers.tmp, you will find line
    ```
    # Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
    # %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
    ```
    uncomment it and we can use sudo command.

#### or

* (optional) If you haven't put the user in wheel group, then specify the permission of your username in following line*

    ```
    # User privilege specification
    root ALL=(ALL) ALL
    user_name ALL=(ALL) ALL
    ```

- To run command inside a user,
    ```bash
    su user_name
    ```

### Step 7 : Update the system and installing required packages

* *Make sure you are in home user by writing "whoami", and you will see the name of user that you are currently logged in.*

* *One more way to check the current user is you may see the Shell prompt some thing like*

    ```bash
    [mukund@archlinux ~]$
    ```
    *where mukund is my username and archlinux is my hostname*

* It is good practice to update the system when you login first time in system. You can do it by,

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```
    and enter your user password.


### Step 8 : Enabling system services and daemons

* Make sure you are in root privilege. It can be done via "sudo su"

* Enable networkmanager with
    ```bash
    systemctl enable NetworkManager 
    ```
* *(optional) You may want to install a login manager like lightdm or sddm, it can be done via the following commands:*
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S lightdm
    sudo pacman -S lightdm-gtk-greeter
    sudo systemctl enable lightdm
    sudo systemctl start lightdm
    ```
    *If you want a plain and minimal arch install it is advisable to use this login manager. But, we will install it when we set-up our desktop environment in further **step number 10**.*

### Step 9 : Bootloader setup

* We will use Grub as out Bootloader.
* Again, make sure you are in root privileges and also in root directory which can be obtained by "cd".
* You can install grub with following command: 
    ```bash
    grub-install /dev/sda
    ```
* Configure grub with:
    ```bash
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    ```
* Reboot


## Congratulation, we have installed the Arch Linux.

### Step 10 : Post-installation

This step is for those who want to install a Desktop Environment. I will install KDE plasma as my desktop environment.

* Firstly, log in to user and update the system with:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```

* To install a complete KDE Plasma Desktop Environment, use following command,

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S plasma-meta kde-applications
    ```
    *Here,*

     *plasma-meta will only install the core plasma*

     *kde-applications will install all its applications and will provide a complete KDE Plasma experience*

* Installing to the login display manager

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sddm
    ```
    Now onward, at the time of boot, it will use sddm as login manager

    However, to access it now, we can use following command:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable --now sddm
    ```

    ## Welcome to KDE Plasma!!
